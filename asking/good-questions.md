# How to ask good questions
Weâ€™d love to help you. To improve your chances of getting an answer, here are some tips:

## Search, and research
...and keep track of what you find. Even if you don't find a useful answer elsewhere on the site, including links to related questions that haven't helped can help others in understanding how your question is different from the rest.

### Write a title that summarizes the specific problem

The title is the first thing potential answerers will see, and if your title isn't interesting, they won't read the rest. So make it count:

* **Pretend you're talking to a busy colleague** and have to sum up your entire question in one sentence: what details can you include that will help someone identify and solve your problem? Include any error messages, key APIs, or unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions already on the site.

* **Spelling, grammar and punctuation are important!** Remember, this is the first part of your question others will see - you want to make a good impression. If you're not comfortable writing in English, ask a friend to proof-read it for you.

If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, **write the title last** - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.

These rules will help you a lot in real life too.
